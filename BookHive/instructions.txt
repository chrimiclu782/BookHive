BookHive Library Management System - Setup and Run Instructions
================================================================

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to set up and run the BookHive application from scratch.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before starting, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. Python 3.x (Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/)
   - Make sure Python is added to your system PATH during installation.

2. MySQL Server (Download from https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
   - Install and start the MySQL service.
   - Note the root password you set during installation (default is often empty, but in this app it's set to "1234" in db.py).

3. Git (optional, if cloning from repository)

Step 1: Install Python Dependencies
-----------------------------------
The application requires PyQt5 for the GUI and mysql-connector-python for database connectivity.

1. Open a command prompt or terminal.
2. Navigate to the BookHive project directory:
   cd c:/Users/chris/Downloads/BookHive

3. Run the dependency installation script:
   python python_codes/install_dependencies.py

   This will automatically install:
   - PyQt5 (GUI framework)
   - mysql-connector-python (MySQL database connector)

   You should see confirmation messages for successful installations.

Step 2: Set Up the Database
---------------------------
The application uses a MySQL database named "BookHiveDB".

1. Ensure MySQL server is running on your system.

2. Open MySQL Command Line Client or any MySQL client tool (like MySQL Workbench).

3. Run the database setup script:
   - If using MySQL Command Line Client:
     mysql -u root -p < database/BookHive.sql
     (Enter your MySQL root password when prompted)

   - If using MySQL Workbench or another GUI tool:
     - Open the tool and connect to your MySQL server
     - Open and execute the file: database/BookHive.sql

   This will:
   - Drop any existing BookHiveDB database
   - Create a new BookHiveDB database
   - Create all necessary tables: Suppliers, Books, Students, Librarians, BookOrders, Borrowed, Returned

Step 3: Run the Application
---------------------------
1. In the command prompt or terminal, ensure you're in the BookHive directory:
   cd c:/Users/chris/Downloads/BookHive

2. Launch the application:
   python python_codes/app.py

3. The BookHive login window should appear.

4. Use the application:
   - Students can register new accounts or login with existing credentials
   - Librarians can login with their credentials
   - Both user types have access to their respective dashboards for library management

Troubleshooting
---------------
- If you encounter database connection errors, verify:
  - MySQL server is running
  - The root password in db.py matches your MySQL setup (currently set to "1234")
  - The database "BookHiveDB" was created successfully

- If PyQt5 installation fails, you may need to install additional system dependencies:
  - On Windows: Install Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable
  - On Linux: Install python3-pyqt5 package via package manager

- Ensure all Python files are in the correct directory structure as provided.

Notes
-----
- The application uses bcrypt for password hashing, so registered passwords are securely stored.
- Default database credentials are hardcoded in db.py for simplicity.
- For production use, consider using environment variables for sensitive information.

For any issues or questions, refer to the individual Python files for more details on functionality.
